"# Project-1" 

This particular project was about coding two clocks (12 Hr and 24 hr format) to display side by side. The clocks needed to be functional by allowing the user to input an initial time, and then be able to add an hour, a minute, or a second via menu options. Time should roll over accordingly.

Personally, I really liked how I formatted my menus, though that wasn't the focus of the project. Finding an efficient way to align everything was puzzling at first, but it became really simple with the use of a couple equations and some use of string formatting. I also think I chose the easiest way to handle two clocks by basing the time on 24 hr format and converting to 12.

I made logic errors in my time rolling over that only displays when --:59:59 occurs and needs to advance. I could have tested that occurance and fixed that. I also could have found a more concise way to translate my time than the switch code I used, it got a little big in the end.

My biggest issue was figuring out how to get my variables moving over from one method to another because I was drawing a blank on how that worked. Honestly once I got going with that, it wasn't very difficult to manage. I still sometimes get caught up on it and need to practice this, and this will be something that will be highly necessary to transfer into future projects.

As for making this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable, a lot of it boils down to variables that allow change depending on the circumstance. My menus, for example, aren't hardcoded. However, like I mentioned before, some of my code is a little longwinded and I could have found a better way to configure it. I still need work in this language.
